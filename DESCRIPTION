Title: Order time-series clusters based on first events
Version: 0.0.0
Date: 2019-April-4
Author: Sandeep Kaur
Maintainer: Sandeep Kaur <crystalsand10@gmail.com>
Description: We provide a package here, which builds upon clusters of high-throughput time-series data (such as time series phosphoproteomics or gene expression datasets). We enable calculating change within clusters at the quantified time points, calculating and plotting the 50% crossings (events), and ordering clusters based on when the events occur.
