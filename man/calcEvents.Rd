\title{Calculate events for the cluster centroids.}
\usage{
calcEvents(timeRegions, clustered, phosEventTh = 0.5,
  dephosEventTh = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{timeRegions}{A list containing the time regions information.}

\item{clustered}{A fclust object containing the clustering details.}

\item{phosEventTh}{Value between 0 and 1, to define the threshold at which a phosphorylation (or increasing) event occurs. Here, a threshold of 0 corresponds to the minimum value within an interval. (Such an event is designated as 1).}

\item{dephosEventTh}{Value between 0 and 1, to define the threshold at which a dephosphorylation (or decreasing) event occurs. A threshold of 0 corresponds to the maximum value within an interval. (Such an event is designated as -1).}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the details of the calculated events for the cluster centroids (time region information is appended to the matrix).
}
